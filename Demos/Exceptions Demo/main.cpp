//In class lab:
//Does the order of the catch statements matter?
//Try mixing up the order of the catch statements.
//what happens? why?
//Try and 'rethrow' the exception (in catch of E1)
//Does 'throw E1' or 'throw e1' or just 'throw' work?
//If not, why?
//How may you still catch the error?
//If a language has a finally catch (... in c++), 
//why does this get called regardless?

//Example using structures

//note: use F5 to launch this or it may show the correct output 
//indicating that the error was caught and yet also indicate an error 
//on a code page that you did not write
